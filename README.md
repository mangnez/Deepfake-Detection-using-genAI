# Deepfake Detection System

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows you to:

1. Detect deepfake videos using a pre-trained TensorFlow video model  
2. Detect deepfake audios using a pre-trained audio classifier  
3. Chat with an AI-powered assistant (via Gemini API) to explore topics related to deepfake detection, risks, countermeasures, legal aspects, and ethical concerns

##  Features

- **Video Deepfake Detection**  
  Upload a video file (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`) and the system will:
  - Extract key frames
  - Run a TensorFlow model to predict whether the video is real or a deepfake
  - Display prediction confidence as an interactive gauge

- **Audio Deepfake Detection**  
  Upload an audio file (`.wav`, `.mp3`) and the system will:
  - Extract the Mel spectrogram
  - Run a TensorFlow model to classify if the audio is real or deepfake
  - Show a confidence gauge

- **Deepfake Chatbot**  
  Use the embedded chatbot (powered by Google Gemini API) to:
  - Ask about deepfake detection technologies, legal regulations, ethical concerns, and AI tools
  - Get warm, topic-specific responses tailored for media and news contexts

##  Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection-system.git
cd deepfake-detection-system
```

2️. **Set up Python environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3️. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4️. **Configure Gemini API key**  
Replace the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the script (`main_app.py`) with your own Gemini API key.
